However, today it's been raining non-stop, causing some inconvenience for those who had planned outdoor events. On the bright side, the rain is beneficial for the crops and gardens, helping them grow healthier. Overall, it's a mixed bag of weather conditions, with both good and not-so-good aspects to consider."
